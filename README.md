# readable-readme

Readable Readme is a Chrome extension that makes it easier to read README files on gitHub. The text is put into a narrower column for shorter lines and less eye strain.

The options for viewing are accessed from the popup.html accessed on the toolbar.

Options:
 - font size
 - font style (sans serif/serif)
 - align (left/center)
 - day/night mode
 - fading

The fading option lets readers fade out list items, paragraphs, and code blocks. This helps to mark your progress when you're trying to follow along.

The settings are saved with Chrome's storage.sync. Your previous settings are currently accessed by opening up the popup.html
